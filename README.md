This Git and all it's contents are not owned by the distributor and have been cleaned for the purpose of allocating a smaller file to the owner and his/her viewers.
#
Some edits have been made to the code to help the user better understand usage of REST API and Unity and these edits have been made to coincide with the video tutorial by PTI Costa Rica, timestamps have been provided within commentary where applicable.
#
The previous edits made by PTI Costa Rica were made in Unity 2017.1.0f3 and the project has been reimported in Unity 2017.1.0p1 and renamed UnityRestAPI for the purpose of matching the tutorial with existing name of the tutorial "Using REST APIs and JSON in Unity".
